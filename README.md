<!--
Stardown is free except that if you get it from Apple's App Store, there is a small fee to help cover the $99 USD per year cost I'm paying to keep Stardown available in the App Store.

We're still finding sites where Stardown doesn't work as well as it could. If you find one, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Stardown-app/Stardown/issues) if one doesn't exist for it yet.

## Privacy

Stardown will never sell any data to anyone and does not collect any personal data. Everything you copy with Stardown is stored in your clipboard, local files, and/or your browser's settings depending on which features you use. Stardown's optional notepad saves to your browser's sync storage by default but can save locally instead.

## Permissions

For why Stardown requests the permissions that it does, see [./docs/permissions.md](./docs/permissions.md).

## Feature requests and alternatives

You're welcome to [make a feature request](https://github.com/Stardown-app/Stardown/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=), and there may already be other software that meets all of your needs. Check out [./docs/alternatives.md](./docs/alternatives.md) for some alternatives to Stardown.

## Development

Contributions are welcome! Let me know (such as in [an issue](https://github.com/Stardown-app/Stardown/issues) or [a discussion](https://github.com/Stardown-app/Stardown/discussions)) what you have in mind ahead of time if you think there's a chance it won't be approved.
