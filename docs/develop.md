# Stardown development

I wrote some general extension development tips in [Making browser extensions](https://til.chriswheeler.dev/making-browser-extensions/).

## priorities

To keep Stardown easy to use, I would like it to never have a popup and to only ever have one context menu option, at least by default. The options page can have many options as long as they are well organized and useful. Stardown's output to the clipboard should render well on at least Obsidian and GitHub, if not also other markdown renderers like VS Code.

I started this project focusing on copying markdown links, but I'm open to the idea of adding a setting that changes the context menu option to copying all selected content as its markdown equivalent.

I would like to keep Stardown relatively simple so that it's reliable, has few bugs that get fixed quickly, and is easy to maintain.

## Git workflow for collaboration

Let's create feature branches with descriptive names and make pull requests, such as described in [Getting started with Git and GitHub](https://chriswheeler.dev/posts/getting-started-with-git-and-github/#git-workflows).

## testing

When fully testing Stardown, test each feature below in each of the officially supported browsers.

- [ ] click the icon
- [ ] right-click a website's header
- [ ] select text, then right-click
- [ ] select an image, then right-click
- [ ] select text and an image, then right-click
- [ ] select multiple images, then right-click
- [ ] right-click the icon
- [ ] right-click a tab (Firefox only)
- [ ] double-click the iconÂ 
- [ ] select tabs, then double-click the icon
- [ ] change settings and repeat as necessary

## why separate browser versions

There are different versions of Stardown for Firefox and the Chromium browsers because of bugs or limitations in them:

* Since [Chromium does not support the Clipboard API in background scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61862872/how-to-copy-web-notification-content-to-clipboard/61977696#61977696), the Chromium version of Stardown also requires the `scripting` permission so it can run a content script that uses the clipboard API.
* In Firefox, [Manifest V3 extensions with low privilege activeTab shows annoying blue dot for all websites](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851083). This is why I changed the Firefox version of Stardown from manifest v3 to v2.
* Although Stardown no longer uses Firefox's manifest v3, [Firefox does not support service_worker in manifest v3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75043889/manifest-v3-background-scripts-service-worker-on-firefox).
* Firefox [sometimes requires an add-on ID](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/extensions-and-the-add-on-id/) in `browser_specific_settings` in manifest.json, but Chromium doesn't allow `browser_specific_settings`.

I wanted to avoid using a build/bundle tool (e.g. Vite) so that the code is more simple and the files are static. The differences between the versions of Stardown are great enough that I'm confident it's worth it. Loading an unpacked extension requires simply telling the browser where the files are; there is no build step.

## text fragments

Text fragments and how to generate them is explained in [this web.dev article](https://web.dev/articles/text-fragments#programmatic_text_fragment_link_generation). The article mentions [a minified version of the text fragment generation code](https://unpkg.com/text-fragments-polyfill@5.7.0/dist/fragment-generation-utils.js), but Stardown doesn't use the minified version because extension stores need to be able to review the code and minifying code doesn't really help extensions.

Stardown's text fragment generation code, which was almost entirely written by Google, is in the files named `text-fragment-utils.js` and `fragment-generation-utils.js`, which are abstracted by `create-text-fragment-arg.js`. The former two files should probably not be changed for anything except fixing bugs or updating to new versions of text fragments.

## long term

If updating the Firefox version of Stardown to manifest v3 before [the blue dot bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851083) is fixed, maybe hide the blue dot with [this CSS](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851083#ct-21:~:text=2%20months%20ago-,the%20dot%20can%20be%20hidden%20with%20this%20css).
