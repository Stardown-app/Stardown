# Feature requests

You're welcome to [make a feature request](https://github.com/Stardown-app/Stardown/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=), and there may already be another browser extension that meets all of your needs. I am not affiliated with any of the below extensions and have not tried all of them; use them at your own risk.

## Download an entire page

Although Stardown can be used to copy an entire page's content as markdown all at once, other tools that specialize in that sometimes give better results.

* [MarkDownload](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload) was developed by an Obsidian community moderator.
* [Obsidian Web Clipper Bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987ca3) is a bookmarklet for saving web pages directly to Obsidian.
* [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) doesn't save pages as markdown but can export them as markdown.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) doesn't save pages as markdown (at least by default), but is one of the best tools for research.

## Copy links in other formats besides markdown

* [url2clipboard](https://github.com/asamuzaK/url2clipboard) supports HTML, Markdown, BBCode, Textile, AsciiDoc, MediaWiki, Jira, reStructuredText, LaTeX, Org Mode, and text.
* [TabCopy](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabcopy/micdllihgoppmejpecmkilggmaagfdmb) might only be on the Chrome Web Store, but supports many formats including HTML, Markdown, BBCode, CSV, and JSON, and lets you create custom link formats.

## Copy just the titles or just the URLs of all tabs

* [Copy as Markdown](https://github.com/yorkxin/copy-as-markdown) is similar to Stardown but has a popup menu with different options, and different priorities in what markdown it generates.

## Copy just a URL with a text fragment

* [link-to-text-fragment](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment) was made by Google itself but is cross-browser.

## Why use Stardown?

Unlike the extensions linked above, Stardown is:

* **Easy to use.** Less clicking, less typing, no setup.
* **Keeps almost all formatting**. Even complex tables are converted to markdown.
* **Creates [text fragments](https://web.dev/articles/text-fragments)** so you can link to specific parts of pages.
