# Manual testing

When fully manually testing Stardown, use the descriptions here in each of the officially supported browsers to search for bugs.

### Context types

When the user right-clicks part of a web page, their browser detects the type of the content they right-clicked and makes that info available to installed browser extensions.

- **selection**: anything that the user has selected by clicking and dragging with their mouse or using selection shortcuts.
- **link**: any clickable link on a page. However, for a link that is also an image, Stardown should show only the image copy option.
- **image**: types supported include png, jpg, svg, webp, gif, and base64-encoded. Types not supported include background images, `canvas` HTML elements, inline `svg` HTML elements, and sometimes images within `a` HTML elements for some reason.
- **video**: a video rendered with the `video` HTML element, such as YouTube videos and mp4 files hosted by GitHub ([example on this page](https://github.com/wheelercj/zq)). This option doesn't appear for some video sites like [Vimeo](https://player.vimeo.com/video/55073825) probably because their `video` HTML element is buried under many other things, and [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) because they don't use the `video` HTML element.
  - Markdown of YouTube videos is expected to render well in Obsidian and Discord, but not in GitHub by default.
  - Markdown of GitHub mp4s is expected to render well only in GitHub.
  - If the user changes the setting "Optimize markdown of YouTube videos for __" to "GitHub", then the output should render well in at least GitHub, Obsidian, and VS Code.
- **audio**: an audio player rendered with the `audio` HTML element. Some good examples are the first two audio players on [New Audio HTML Element: Master It Out Now With Our Code Example Â»](https://html.com/tags/audio/).
- **table**: a table of data rendered with the `table` HTML element. Browsers do not offer a built-in context type for this, so Stardown has its own table detection code that runs each time the user makes a selection.

### Features

- [ ] **Pressing any button in the popup** should do what the button's text describes.
- [ ] **Pressing Alt+C** copies a markdown link for the page, unless part of the page is selected in which case markdown of the selection is copied instead.
- [ ] **Right-clicking an empty part of a page** shows the "Copy markdown link for this page" and "Copy markdown link for this section" options.
- [ ] **Right-clicking a website's unselected header** shows the "Copy markdown link for this page" and "Copy markdown link for this section" options.
- [ ] **Right-clicking selected text** shows the "Copy markdown of selection" option.
- [ ] **Right-clicking an unselected image** shows the "Copy markdown of image" option.
- [ ] **Selecting text, then right-clicking an unselected image**, due to browser limitations, shows no context menu option in Chromium and shows "Copy markdown of selection" in Firefox.
- [ ] **Selecting text and image(s), then right-clicking the selected text** shows the "Copy markdown of selection" option.
- [ ] **Selecting text and image(s), then right-clicking a selected image** shows the "Copy markdown of selection" option.
- [ ] **Selecting text and link(s), then right-clicking a selected link** shows the "Copy markdown of selection" option.
- [ ] **Right-clicking a link that is not an image** shows the "Copy markdown of link" option.
- [ ] **Right-clicking a link that is an image** might not show any context menu options due to browser limitations. If a context menu option appears, it should be "Copy markdown of image".
- [ ] **Right-clicking a video** shows the "Copy markdown of video" option, but may require a second right-click for the correct context menu to appear because some videos (e.g. YouTube videos) have a special context menu.
- [ ] **Right-clicking an audio player** shows the "Copy markdown of audio" option.
- [ ] **Selecting the contents of a table and right-clicking the selection** shows several options: "Copy markdown of table", "Copy TSV of table", "Copy CSV of table", "Copy JSON of table", and "Copy HTML of table". Each option should result in a table with everything aligned correctly, leaving some cells empty and others duplicated as necessary.
- [ ] "Copy markdown link for this page" copies a markdown link for the page. The link is guaranteed to not have an HTML element ID nor a text fragment.
- [ ] "Copy markdown link for this section" copies a markdown link for the page with the nearest HTML element ID above (*above* in the HTML element tree sense) where the page was right-clicked.
- [ ] "Copy markdown of selection", by default, copies markdown of the selected text (including all of the page's formatting that markdown supports), and a markdown link containing a text fragment and possibly an HTML element ID.
- [ ] "Copy markdown of image" copies markdown of the image using the image's URL and any alt text.
- [ ] "Copy markdown of link" copies markdown of the link, using the same title and URL as the link in the page (except for any character escapes or encodings).
- [ ] "Copy markdown of video" copies markdown of the video using the video source's URL.
- [ ] "Copy markdown of audio" copies a markdown link to either an audio file or a site that plays the audio.
- [ ] **Change settings and repeat as necessary**
