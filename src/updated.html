  Consider adding the following information to the update page:

  - A brief description of your extension. This should be enough so your regular users
    can identify which extension has updated and enough to entice lapsed users back to
    using the extension.
  - A list of the new or improved features or issues corrected in this update. Include
    information on how to find and use the new or improved features.
  - If any of the new features require payment to use, let the user know what those
    features are and how much they cost. If you have tiered payments, provide a
    comparison chart or link to one on the extensionâ€™s website. This is also a good time
    to request donations, remembering to add a link to the donate page.
  - Provide links to key information such as the extension support page, help guide,
    tutorials, and alike.
