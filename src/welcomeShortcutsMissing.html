      <h3>Thanks for installing Stardown! Some keyboard shortcuts were not set.</h3>
      <p>
        This page is just here to inform you that Stardown was not allowed to add at
        least one of the keyboard shortcuts it usually sets by default. You might have
        another extension already using those shortcuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you plan to use the shortcuts, take a look at Stardown's settings for how to
        change them.
