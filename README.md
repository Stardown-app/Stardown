<!--
Stardown is free except that if you get it from Apple's App Store, there is a small fee to help cover the $99 USD per year cost I'm paying to keep Stardown available in the App Store.

## Privacy

Stardown will never sell any data to anyone and does not collect any personal data. Everything you copy with Stardown is stored in your clipboard, local files, and/or your browser's settings depending on which features you use. Stardown's optional notepad saves to your browser's settings.

## Why Stardown?

Stardown is:

* **Flexible**. Integrates well with many workflows. Select almost anything, copy and paste anywhere.
* **Instantly clip** into a note using Stardown's sidebar notepad to both copy and paste with `Alt+C`.
* **Better at converting**. Stardown's custom code for converting HTML to markdown can convert more formatting than alternatives.
* **Creates [text fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments)** so you can link to specific parts of pages.
* **Extensible**. Stardown is designed to be extended for more markdown flavors and other markup languages.
